<h2>Preamble</h2>
<div class="preamble">We may update policies from time to time; we may announce significant changes (i.e. changes to the intent of the policy), however it is your responsibility to review and understand these terms.

Your use of this website implies an acceptance of the General Terms and Conditions; creation of an account or use of the video sessions implies your additional acceptance of the Account Terms and Conditions.</div>

<h2>General Terms and Conditions</h2>
<div class="preamble">This website and all information is presented on an as-is basis, with no warranty or guarantee of reliability or accuracy.

Information is presented for personal use only.
You may not copy this site or any information or media used without prior consent.

<h2>Account Terms and Conditions</h2>
<div class="preamble">The following terms apply (in addition to the General terms) for anyone who signs up, creates an account, or uses an existing account.
Before creating or using an account you must be an adult, be able to understand these terms, and consent to them.

You may only create an account if you intend to participate in our online sessions as a student; or as an organiser if invited by Adelaide Acrobalance.

Your account is non-transferable and may only be used by you.
You may join in video sessions while other people are present with you, however it is your responsibility to ensure they also understand and follow the requirements of the sessions.

We may, at our sole discretion, choose who shall be allowed to join sessions, remove participants from sessions, or remove accounts.

You agree we may use all information you provide or that is publicly available when authorising accounts.
You agree that when joining a session, your name and video stream may be shown to other participants.

When participating in sessions, you must remain polite and respectful to all participants and organisers.
You should participate as best is appropriate for yourself, taking consideration to your own physical capabilities at the time.
You should ask for alternative options or provide feedback whenever you need; but must not disrupt the (intent of) the sessions, e.g. with unrelated discussion.

You must not record or use video sessions in a public place.

You accept that we may choose how to enforce these and other rules as we feel appropriate; but we accept no liability for any lack of or delay in moderation.</div>

<section id="privacy">
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<div>This policy was last updated: <strong>Jan 17th, 2021</strong>.</div>

<h2>Online Accounts</h2>
<div class="preamble">In order to participate in online sessions, you will be required to create an account.
You may create an anonymous account, sign up with an email address, or sign in with an external provider (e.g. Facebook or Google or other providers as we support).

Your name (which you may update, e.g. to a nickname) will be shown to other participants during any online sessions you join.

In order to protect the privacy of participants and the operation of sessions, all online accounts will need to be approved before they may join a session.
We may use any of the details you provide when signing up, or public data provided by Google/Facebook/other, to identify and approve your account.

The account details are stored and managed by Google services.
We may choose to migrate your information to another account management provider provided a similar level of security is expected.

Your chosen display name and any details sent by your computer will be shared with the video conference provider when you join a session.

You may request we delete your information at any time.</div>

<h2>In-Person Classes</h2>
<div class="preamble">When you first attend an in-person class, you will be asked to fill in a membership form.
Please ensure you read the form and ask any questions you may have.
You can view a copy of the membership form <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Maq4ABESGS6iNSuoC3ozqyR-Xn1ENETZ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, although it may not be the most recent version.

Each time you attend an in-person class, you will also be asked to fill in an attendance form.</div>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<div class="preamble">In case we need to cancel a class, we may contact you using the details you provide.
This will normally only be if we think it is likely you would attend (e.g. you attended the previous session, or indicated you were coming), and you would not know from other sources (e.g. if you normally see our posts on Facebook).

Your "in case of emergency" details will only be used by us in the case of an emergency, we may also provide these details to health professionals or police.

Any details you provide for first aiders or medical professionals will only be used if first aid or medical attention is required.

Any details may also be provided to police or government departments when legally required; for example your attendance and contact details may be provided to SAHealth in the event of CoViD-19 contact tracing.</div>

<h3>Access to your own information</h3>
<div class="preamble">If you wish to review what data you have provided to us, to make alterations, or remove any information, you are welcome to do so at class.
In the event that you are unable to attend in person, we may require reasonable proof of identity first.

We may limit changes as required by law; e.g. while we are required to maintain contact tracing details you may update your contact information but not remove them.</div>

<h3>Where we store your information</h3>
<div class="preamble">In addition to the paper forms, which may be used by Adelaide Acrobalance organisers or instructors; digital copies of forms may be kept on private computers, or stored with private access on cloud providers (e.g. uploaded to Google storage).</div>
