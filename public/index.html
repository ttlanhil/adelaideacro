    <h3>Class Schedule</h3>
    <span class="preamble">What we practice changes each week depending on people's energy and interests.
    The following is a rough guide, people are welcome to finish early or take a break whenever they need.
    Classes run each Wednesday evening (with a break over new year) on a casual basis, there are no set terms.</span>
    <div>
        <h4>7pm: Sign-in &amp; Warmup</h4>
        <p>On your first night we'll ask you to fill in a membership form (contact details, emergency details, waiver, media release, etc.)
        Each week, at least until things settle down, we'll also ask you to sign-in for contact tracing.

        We'll then go through a quick warm-up and some dynamic stretching - just to loosen up joints and activate muscles, we won't be working hard yet!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>7:30pm: Tumbling</h4>
        <p>Each week we'll practice rolling and falling - starting from the basics, and adding some momentum or height as people are ready.
        We'll work up to cartwheels, handstands, and any other skills you'd like to try!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>8pm: Partner Acrobatics</h4>
        <p>We usually start partner work with some dynamic acrobatics - dance lifts/aerials, pitching (think cheerleading), etc.
        After this we'll often split into smaller groups as people work on different things - beginners will be introduced to the basics, while more experienced acrobats work on fancier skills!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>8:45pm: First Cool-Down</h4>
        <p>You're welcome to stay until 10pm, or to leave earlier, whatever suits your schedule and energy.
        If you are leaving earlier, you're welcome to do your own stretch and cool-down, or we can guide you through it while others continue to acro.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>9:15pm: Conditioning</h4>
        <p>Acrobalance - and life in general - gets easier as you work on physical training!
        We'll work on strength, stability, and flexibility so that you can do more cool stuff next week!
        It doesn't matter if you need to do pushups on your knees, or struggle to be able to look up, we'll have progression options for you!
        We're all working on improving our fitness - some of us started acro a long way from being able to touch our toes!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>10pm: Packup</h4>
        <p>Lending a hand with cleaning and pack-up would be welcome, otherwise head home and get a good night's rest!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Who… Is it for?</h4>
        <p>Anyone who wants to have fun, meet interesting people, and learn partner/group acro.
        Beginners are always welcome (there are no set terms, so start any time).
        Classes are aimed at adults, but you can bring your children if you’re participating and they’re under your supervision.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>What… Is Acrobalance?</h4>
        <p>Think partner/group acrobatics.
        Beginners start with training close to the ground, and you can work up to things like standing lifts (e.g. the Dirty Dancing lift), standing on someone’s shoulders, or a human pyramid.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>What… Should I bring/wear?</h4>
        <p>Wear comfortable clothing that you can move freely in; any sort of activewear is ideal.
        We train barefoot, however you’re welcome to wear socks or shoes during warmup/cooldown.
        Bring your own water bottles, and a towel may be handy on warmer days.</p>
