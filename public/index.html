    <h3>Adelaide Acrobalance - acro classes for adults!</h3>
    <div>Adelaide Acrobalance run weekly open community classes.<br/>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">What even is acrobalance?</span> Think partner/group acrobatics.
    Beginners start with training close to the ground, and you can work up to things like standing lifts (e.g. the Dirty Dancing lift), standing on someone’s shoulders, or a human pyramid.</div>

<section class="accordion" id="schedule">
    <h3>Class Schedule</h3>
    <span class="preamble">What we practice changes each week depending on people's energy and interests.
    The following is a rough guide, people are welcome to finish early or take a break whenever they need.

    Classes run each Wednesday evening (with a break over new year) on a casual basis, there are no set terms.</span>
    <div>
        <h4>7pm: Sign-in &amp; Warmup</h4>
        <p>On your first night we'll ask you to fill in a membership form (contact details, emergency details, waiver, media release, etc.)
        Each week, at least until things settle down, we'll also ask you to sign-in for contact tracing.

        We'll then go through a quick warm-up and some dynamic stretching - just to loosen up joints and activate muscles, we won't be working hard yet!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>7:30pm: Tumbling</h4>
        <p>Each week we'll practice rolling and falling - starting from the basics, and adding some momentum or height as people are ready.
        We'll work up to cartwheels, handstands, and any other skills you'd like to try!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>8pm: Partner Acrobatics</h4>
        <p>We usually start partner work with some dynamic acrobatics - dance lifts/aerials, pitching (think cheerleading), etc.
        After this we'll often split into smaller groups as people work on different things - beginners will be introduced to the basics, while more experienced acrobats work on fancier skills!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>8:45pm: First Cool-Down</h4>
        <p>You're welcome to stay until 10pm, or to leave earlier, whatever suits your schedule and energy.
        If you are leaving earlier, you're welcome to do your own stretch and cool-down, or we can guide you through it while others continue to acro.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>9:15pm: Conditioning</h4>
        <p>Acrobalance - and life in general - gets easier as you work on physical training!
        We'll work on strength, stability, and flexibility so that you can do more cool stuff next week!
        It doesn't matter if you need to do pushups on your knees, or struggle to be able to look up, we'll have progression options for you!
        We're all working on improving our fitness - some of us started acro a long way from being able to touch our toes!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>10pm: Packup</h4>
        <p>Lending a hand with cleaning and pack-up would be welcome, otherwise head home and get a good night's rest!</p>
    </div>

<section id="aboutus">
    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <div class="preamble">Adelaide Acrobalance formed in 2020, replacing acrobalance classes previously taught by ZigZag Circus, and founded by participants of those classes.

    We all come from different backgrounds (circus, yoga, dance, gymnastics, contortion, powerlifting, etc), with different experiences, different teachers we've learned from, and different tricks we've learned... and we know someone coming for their first time will have skills and techniques to share as well!

    We try to run classes in a collaborative way - working on skills that people want to learn, and all contributing to the group's learning.
    Everyone is welcome to make requests or suggestions, and to decide what they're comfortable with doing - and if you're not comfortable with something, to say so and we'll find an alternative.
    This is an adult class, we don't want you to just do what we say without thinking about it!

    Classes are free in order to keep them as accessible as possible; contributions towards costs (mostly venue hire, but also insurance, etc.) are welcome, but if money's tight we'd rather you came along and joined our community without paying.

    If you have any issues at class, please talk to the teacher if relevant, speak with Adam (facilitator/owner), or if that's difficult, with Jane.

    <h3>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h3>
    <div>
        <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
        <p>Anyone who wants to have fun, meet interesting people, and learn partner/group acro.
        Beginners are always welcome (there are no set terms, so start any time).
        Classes are aimed at adults, but you can bring your children if you’re participating and they’re under your supervision.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>What should I bring/wear?</h4>
        <p>Wear comfortable clothing that you can move freely in; any sort of activewear is ideal.
        We train barefoot, however you’re welcome to wear socks or shoes during warmup/cooldown.
        Bring your own water bottles, and a towel may be handy on warmer days.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Why should I go?</h4>
        <p>It’s fun, it’s inclusive, you get to meet cool people and stand on them (or have them stand on you)!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
        <p>Classes are free, however contributions towards costs are greatly appreciated
        BSB: 105-029
        Acc: 088 150 540

        We'll also appreciate help with setup/packup, taking photos, bringing friends and family, and (most importantly) being a member of our community</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>How do I get started?</h4>
        <p>Send us a message saying when you’d like to come along (during COVID we may need to restrict numbers), if you want to know more, or have any questions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Can I watch?</h4>
        <p>Classes are for joining in - people are more comfortable if everyone's participating rather than if they're being watched.
        That said, if you're unsure but interested in seeing what it's like...
        &bull; You're welcome to sit out some parts and just work on skills you're more comfortable with,
        &bull; We have plenty of experienced people keen to help you get started, and
        &bull; There's no cost
        So why not come along and join in?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Do I need to be fit/strong/flexible?</h4>
        <p>Not particularly - if you can hold a plank (push-up position) and do a couple of squats you should be good to get started!
        More will help, of course (and allow you to do more cool things), but as you come along and practice acro you'll develop your strength, flexibility, and body awareness (particularly if you join us for conditioning)
        </p>
