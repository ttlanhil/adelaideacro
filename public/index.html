<h2>We've moved!</h2>
We are now training in a new venue - see <a href="/index.html#circobats">here</a> for more details
</div>

<section id="home" style="display:initial;">
    <h1>Adelaide Acrobalance - acro classes for adults!</h1>
    <div>We run weekly open community classes.<br/>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">What even is acrobalance?</span> We train in partner/group acrobatics, along with handbalancing and a bit of tumbling.

    Beginners usually start with training close to the ground, and you can work up to things like standing lifts (e.g. the Dirty Dancing lift), standing on someoneâ€™s shoulders, or a human pyramid.

    If you've ever seen circus acrobats, then you've seen some of the skills you can work towards - starting with the basics of course!
    Or if dance lifts are your thing, then yes, we can teach those!

<!--     We also run weekly <a href="/index.html#stretch_strengthen">Stretch &amp; Strengthen</a> classes; see that page for more details. -->
    </div>
</section>


<section class="accordion" id="schedule">
    <h1>Acrobalance Class Schedule</h1>
    <span class="preamble">
    What we practice changes each week depending on people's energy and interests.
    The following is a rough guide, people are welcome to finish early or take a break whenever they need.

    Classes run every Wednesday evening.
    There are no set terms, you can drop in or out depending on your schedule.</span>
    <div>
        <h2>6:45pm: Sign-in</h2>
        <p>On your first night we will ask you to fill in a membership form (contact details, emergency details, waiver, media release, etc.)
        Each week we also ask you to sign-in for our own records, as well as sign-in with COVID-SAfe.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>7pm: Warmup</h2>
        <p>We will go through a quick warm-up and some dynamic stretching to loosen up joints and wake up the lazier muscles.
        The warm-up will be mostly the same each week, however we will focus on different things depending on what people would like to work on that evening.
        If you prefer to do your own warm-up, you're welcome to do so - but please still be with the group so we can plan for the evening.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>7:30pm: Tumbling</h2>
        <p>Each week we practice rolling and falling; starting from the basics, and adding some momentum or height as people are ready.
        We work up to cartwheels, handstands, and any other skills you want to try!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>8pm: Partner Acrobatics</h2>
        <p>We often start partner work with some dynamic acrobatics - dance lifts/aerials, pitching (as used in cheerleading), etc.
        After this we may split into smaller groups as people work on different skills.
        Beginners will be introduced to the basics, while more experienced acrobats work on fancier tricks.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>8:45pm: First Cool-Down</h2>
        <p>You are welcome to stay until 10pm, or to leave earlier, whatever suits your schedule and energy.
        If you are leaving earlier, let us know and we can guide you through a stretch and cool-down while others continue to acro.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>9:15pm: Conditioning</h2>
        <p>Acrobalance (and life in general) gets easier as you work on physical training!
        We work on our strength, stability, and flexibility so that we can do more cool stuff next week
        It doesn't matter if you do pushups on your knees, or struggle to be able to look at the ceiling, we'll have progression options for you!
        We're all working on improving our fitness - some of us started acro a long way from being able to touch our toes!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>10pm: Packup</h2>
        <p>Help with cleaning and packing up equipment is greatly appreciated, otherwise head home and get a good night's rest!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="preamble">
    As of the 30th of June, we will be training at CircoBats:
    775 South Rd (entry off Emerson Road)
    Black Forest SA 5035

    This is next to the bridge over Cross Rd; a 10 minute drive from the city, and a 2 minute walk from Emerson railway station.
    There is a large carpark - head in, check in, and we'll see you there!

    <h1>Moving to CircoBats</h1>
    <div class="preamble">
    As of June 30th, we will be training at <a href="/index.html#location">CircoBats</a> - we are excited to share the new opportunities this will bring for us!

    When you arrive, please check in with CoViD-SAfe for the venue, wash hands, and put shoes and bags in the storage area.
    We will meet in the lounge area before moving into the training space at 7pm.

    While we are training there will be CircoBats classes running - handstands, aerial silks, and open training.
    We may move around from time to time to share the space and equipment.
    Please stick together with the rest of our group and only use the equipment as directed by our instructors - we are operating under separate insurance and class setup from CircoBats.
    If you prefer to use other equipment and train under your own direction, you may prefer CircoBats' <a href="https://www.circobats.com/open-training">open training</a>.

    Already doing open training, but would like to join in for a bit of acro (or join us for conditioning after your training)?
    That will usually be fine - send a message or come over for a chat!

<section id="stretch_strengthen">
    <h1>Stretch &amp; Strengthen Classes</h1>
    <div class="preamble">
    <b>Note:</b> As this is a new class, we are seeking feedback and will make adjustments to the schedule.

    It will also help to have:
    &bull; A mat or some cushions/pillows (particularly on a hard floor)
    &bull; Drinking water

<section id="aboutus">
    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="preamble">
    Adelaide Acrobalance formed in 2020, replacing acrobalance classes previously taught by ZigZag Circus.
    Adelaide Acrobalance was founded by participants of those classes.

    We all come from different backgrounds (circus, yoga, dance, gymnastics, contortion, powerlifting, etc), with different experiences, different teachers, and different tricks we have learned.
    We know someone attending for their first time will have skills and techniques to share as well!

    We try to run classes in a collaborative way; working on skills that people want to learn, and having everyone contributing to the group's learning.

    Anyone is welcome to make requests or suggestions and to decide what they are comfortable with doing.
    If you are not comfortable with a proposed activity for whatever reason (e.g. physical limitations, mental barriers, lack of related practice, etc.), you are more than welcome to ask to do something different or more suitable for you.
    This is an adult class, we don't want you to just do what we say without thinking about it!

    Classes are free in order to remove income as a barrier, though contributions towards costs are welcome.

    If you have any issues in class, please talk to the instructor or Adam (facilitator/owner).
    </div>
</section>


<section id="safety">
    <h1>Safety &amp; Inclusivity</h1>
    <div class="preamble">
    At Adelaide Acrobalance we value safety, respect, inclusivity, and community.

    We use evidence-based approaches to physical training, start each night working on safe falling techniques, and encourage everyone to find the adjustments that their body needs.

    Most partner acro starts with a base (the person on the ground), flier (the person being supported), and one or more spotters (who are ready to catch the flier if needed).
    We encourage people to learn each role; understanding the challenges and responsibilities of others helps us to be better acrobats.


    We want to meet all the good humans!
    Money, gender, orientation, race, etc. are no barriers to doing acro.
    Disabilities, injuries, and different levels of physical ability can affect acro, but we can work to each person's capabilities and strengths.

    We welcome everyone who will respect their fellow acrobat; respecting boundaries, seeking enthusiastic consent, using the correct pronouns, etc.
    </div>

<section class="accordion preview" id="faqs">
    <h1>Frequently Anticipated Questions</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
        <p>Anyone who wants to have fun, meet interesting people, and learn partner/group acro.
        Beginners are always welcome (there are no set terms, so start any time).
        Classes are aimed at adults, but you can bring your children if youâ€™re participating and theyâ€™re under your supervision.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>What should I bring/wear?</h2>
        <p>Wear comfortable clothing that you can move freely in; any sort of activewear is ideal.
        We train barefoot, however youâ€™re welcome to wear socks or shoes during warmup/cooldown.
        Jewellery and watches should be left in your bag or covered up where possible, as they may get caught during acro.
        Bring your own water bottles, and a towel may be handy on warmer days.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Why should I go?</h2>
        <p>Itâ€™s a fun way to get exercise and you get to meet cool people and stand on them (or have them stand on you)!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>That's up to you!
        Instructors aren't paid and we have a good deal for using the space - if you can afford to contribute $5-10 that will be greatly appreciated to help cover costs.

        If it's a bit difficult to afford, that's fine, come anyway!
        We'd rather people come for free and don't have to miss out.

        The preferred payment method is bank transfer (we can also accept cash at class):
        BSB: 105-029
        Acc: 088 150 540

        We also appreciate help with setup/packup, taking and sharing photos, bringing friends and family, and (most importantly) being a member of our community</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
        <p>Send us a message saying when youâ€™d like to come along, if you want to know more, or have any questions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Can I watch?</h2>
        <p>While we understand that acrobatics can be impressive to observe, our classes are for participating.
        People are more comfortable if everyone's participating rather than if they're being watched.

        That said, if you're unsure but interested in seeing what it's like:
        &bull; You're welcome to sit out some parts and just work on skills you're more comfortable with
        &bull; We have plenty of experienced people keen to help you get started
        &bull; There's no cost
        So why not come along and join in?

        If you are still not convinced in joining in and do just want to watch us, keep an eye out on out social media pages for shows that Adelaide Acrobalance may put on in the future.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Do I need to be fit/strong/flexible?</h2>
        <p>Not particularly; if you can hold a plank (push-up position) and do a couple of bodyweight squats you should be good to get started!
        More strength and/or flexibility will help, of course (and allow you to do more cool things), but as you come along and practice acro you'll develop your strength, flexibility, and body awareness (especially if you join us for conditioning).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Can I attend occasionally?</h2>
        <p>Sure! We know that some people have schedules which only allow them to join in intermittently, you are welcome to drop in and out from week to week.
        If you will be attending occasionally, please let us know - and if you will have time, ask us for suggestions for conditioning at home so you can do more cool stuff on your next visit!
